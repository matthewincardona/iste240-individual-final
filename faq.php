          <h4>What should I bring?</h4>
          <p>
            It can get very hot outside, especially after walking around for
            some long, so it’s important to bring sunscreen and plenty of water.
            Comfy shoes are also recommended.

          <h4>Can I walk on the boats?</h4>
          <p>
            Yes, a lot of Boats on Display offer self and guided tours. Boats
            that offer tours often have someone onbard to answer any questions
            you might have. Please be curteous when on someone else’s boat.

            The show is completely self-guided, so you’re free to stay as much
            or as little as you would like. Please be mindful of when the show
            closes for the day.
